# Mean blur filter implemented on C with the purpose of obtaining knowledge

This repository was made for a homework assignment in the course EA876 - Software
Introduction at Unicamp. The main purpose of the code here is to compare different
approaches of implementing a blur filter. The median blur filter was the default option and i chose
that filter.


## Requirements

- This repository was made on a **Linux** machine and was not tested on **Windows (MinGW)** nor **MacOS**
- You have to run this repository on a desktop, not on a server, because you have to view the image and the pdf document
- For the plots I used GNUPlot
- I opened the images and the pdf with **xdg-open** so you have to have a preferred application on your computer
- Obviously you must have GNU core-utils (make,gcc,...)
- I compiled the final document with **PdfLatex** using the following packages:
  1. float
  2. fancyvrb
  3. graphicx
  4. dvispname
