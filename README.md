# Mean blur filter implemented on C with the purpose of obtaining knowledge

This repository was made for a homework assignment in the course EA876 - Software
Introduction at Unicamp. The main purpose of the code here is to compare different
approaches of implementing a blur filter. The median blur filter was the default option and i chose
that filter.


## Requirements

- This repository was made on a **Linux** machine and was not tested on **Windows (MinGW)** nor **MacOS**
- You have to run this repository on a desktop, not on a server, because you have to view the image and the pdf document
- For the plots I used GNUPlot
- I opened the images and the pdf with **xdg-open** so you have to have a preferred application on your computer
- Obviously you must have gcc
- I compiled the final document with **PdfLatex** using the following packages:
1. float
2. fancyvrb
3. graphicx
4. dvispname

## Instructions on how to use

- **Postfix** to send and receive mail.
- **Dovecot** to get mail to your email client (mutt, Thunderbird, etc).
- Config files that unique the two above securely with native log-ins.
- **Spamassassin** to prevent spam and allow you to make custom filters.
